		///// TERNARY OPERATOR: /////

TERNARY OPERATOR (also known as the conditional operator) can be used to replace if..else in certain scenarios.

Ternary Operator: A ternary operator evaluates the test condition and executes a block of code based on the result of the condition.

===> condition ? expression1:expression2;

Here, condition is evaluated and.
if condition is true, expression1 is executed.
And, if condition is false, expression2 is executed.

The ternary operator takes 3 operands(condition, expression1, and expression2). Hence, the name ternary operator.

## Example1:
#include<iostream>
#include<string>
using namespace std;
int main(){
	double marks;
	cout<<"Enter marks: "<<endl;
	cin>>marks;
	string res=(marks>=40)?"Passed":"failed";
	cout<<"you"<<res<<"the exam"<<endl;
return 0;
}
### NOTE::: We should only use the ternary operator if the resulting statement is short.



		///// NESTED TERNARY OPERATOR: /////
It is also possible to use one ternary operator inside another ternary operator. It is called the nested ternary operator in c++.

## Example2: 
#include<iostream>
#include<string>
using namespace std;
int main(){
	int number;
	string result;
	cin>>number;
	result=(number==0)?"Zero":((number>0)?"Positive":"Negative");
	cout<<"Number is: "<<result<<endl;
return 0;
}

### NOTE::: It's not recommended to use nested ternary operators. This is because it makes our code more complex..
